## Why

I have created several Vite apps recently. Setting the configs up is kinda the bottleneck for me to make the ideas simply come true within a very short time.

So I made this starter template for myself to create apps more easily, along with some good practices that I have learned from making those apps. It's strongly opinionated, but feel free to tweak it or even maintains your own forks. [(see community maintained variation forks)](#variations)
